This project was created for the Object-Oriented Programming course at the AGH UST in 2021/2022.

## Description
This project is the implementation of the **Tetris** game.

## Features
- Displaying the next shapes,
- Displaying a history of the best scores (saved in a file, so they are visible when playing the next time after closing the window),
- Possibility to choose between an easy mode (traditional Tetris with 4-segment shapes) or a hard mode (with 5-segment shapes),
- A possibility to enable random bombs spawning (bombs destroy the bricks making it easier for the player to achieve a high score)

## Core technology stack
- Java 16,
- Gradle,
- JavaFX
